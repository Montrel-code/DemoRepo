My name is Justin Garrison. I’m 21 years old. I was born and raised in Aiken SC, roughly 3 hours from Charleston. My hobbies include:  playing guitar, meditation/yoga, as well as tossing the ol’ frisbee disc about at the beach. I play in a local band here in Charleston as the rhythm guitarist, looking forward to playing shows again when Coronavirus has run its course. I’m excited for this semester and this class!Cheers,Justin G Garrison, Justin		CSCI 362-02
