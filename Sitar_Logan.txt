Hello Dr. Bowring, my name is Logan Sitar and I am a senior here at CofC.
I am orginally from Connecticut but moved down to Myrtle Beach, SC my sophomore year of highschool.
I have a deep love for any boardsports, though surfing and snowboarding are my favorite.
I am very excited to take this class becasue it is something I can see myself doing after graduating.
One fun fact about me is that I have a three and a half foot ball python and her name is Olive. 
I look forward to learning Software Engineering with you!
