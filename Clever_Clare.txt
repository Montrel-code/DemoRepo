Hi, My name is Clare Clever. I am a senior here at the College of Charleston and am a computer science major.

This summer I did an internship at Leidos (working remotely) as a systems engineer.
During my time at Leidos I got to work on some really cool projects for the FAA.

This summer I also had the privalage of participating in the RISE leadership program for Capgemini.

In 2021 I will be joining Leidos Full-Time as a software engineer working on the FAA's ERAM program.
